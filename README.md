# Information.-Systems

This is an application for the management of data from the publications domain, like https://dblp.org/.

Informations can be retrieved from MongoDB (document-oriented database), ZooDB (object database) or BaseX (XML database).

The different back end solutions can be used at the same time. The front end is a webgui.

Standard queries (find publications by filter,...) and more complex ones like shortest path between to authors, i.e., the author distance serve as tasks to analyse the impedance mismatch problem.
